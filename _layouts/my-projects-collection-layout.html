<!-- 
This is a bit hacky and not how this theme is supposed to be used at all, anyway:
we close here the surround class div, which takes the layout: archive as given in the header.
Then, we just create a second archive div and put our second collection in there, which allows us to have two collections on one page 
without breaking any layouting :)
</div> 

<div class="archive">
  <h1 class="page__title">
    Write-up coming (maybe) soon...:
  </h1>
  
  <div class="entries-{{ page.entries_layout }}">
    {% include documents-collection.html collection=page.second_collection sort_by=page.sort_by sort_order=page.sort_order type=page.entries_layout %}
  </div>
