<h1>About me</h1>
Hey, I'm Finn Rietz, an AI enthusiast and computer scientist from Germany.
I am a last year Ph.D. student at the Learning Systems Lab at Örebro University, Sweden, where I work on Reinforcement Learning (RL), Representation Learning, and Probabilistic Models.
I am expected to graduate in 2026 and am currently looking for applied research or engineering positions in the field of AI, ML, and RL.

<h1>About this site</h1>
This sites is subject to mainly two ideas:<br>
Firstly, I want to contribute to the community and share my insight about topics I care about, especially where I experienced a lack of material or documentation.
Secondly, this website serves as my digital business card.
Hence, you find some of my works and projects on here as well, which aim at illustrating a part of my skill-set.
Note, since starting my Ph.D., I haven't found much time for keeping this site up-to-date and have accumulated a great backlog of posts that I am planning to share here -- I will hopefully find time for that soon!
